How to configure your computer system to use the "Use audio FFT" live input featurte

(document version 1.1.0)


---------------------------------------------


  Chromium/XUL mode of System Animator supports direct sound spectrum analysis via Web Audio API. By enabling "live input", this feature works not only on media file playing on
the animation, but also ANY sound playing on your computer, just like Spectrum Analyser. This feature also opens some future possibilities beyond the Spectrum Analyser.

  The "live input" feature is implemented via the HTML5 "getUserMedia" API, which picks an audio input from the user's computer. Such audio input is usually a microphone by
default, or it can be any other audio source. For System Animator, the "live input" feature requires the "Stereo Mix" input to be ON, and is the DEFAULT input device.


1. (RECOMMENDED) Check out the following page and see how you can turn "Stereo Mix" on, and make it the default input/recording device.

2. On some systems, it is impossible to enable "Stereo Mix". In this case, you can use some kind of virtual cable or virtual soundcard software to establish a virtual link
between any audio source and the microphone input. Below are some softwares you may try.

3. If none of the above works, there is still a final way. You can use an audio cable to connect the headphone output to the microphone input.

4. Lastly, the current implementation of getUserMedia requires that the input and output device are using the SAME sample rate. Follow step 1 and check out the playback and
recording devices on your computer. Choose Properties => Advanced, and make sure the output and input device use the same sample rate.


  The getUserMedia API is still a new and experimental feature, and the live input feature may not work on every system. In fact, for those System Animator animations that
support direct playback of audio/video files, the live input feature is NOT required at all. For such animations, simply enable "Use audio FFT" without "live input", and the
audio part will still be analysed properly.


  In the worst case, you still have Spectrum Analyser :P
