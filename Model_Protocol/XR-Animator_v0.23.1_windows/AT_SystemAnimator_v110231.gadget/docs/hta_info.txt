System Animator - HTA mode

(document version 1.7.1)


---------------------------------------------


Introduction:

  Since version 5.0, System Animator can be run as a standalone application (HTA / HTML Application) WITHOUT the sidebar platform. Running System Animator
in HTA mode has the following advantages.

1) consumes LESS CPU power (especially with GPU acceleration enabled)
2) allows child animations
3) uses HTML5 Canvas (effectively replacing Silverlight) and other advanced Web technologies to allow more visual effects and possibilities
4) supports using video file (MP4) directly as animation (this type of System Animator animation is called "SEQ Video"), with chroma key support (ie. transparent background)

  Check out the following video introducing HTA/XUL mode with more details.

System requirements:

- Internet Explorer 9 (or above) installed

Laucnh System Animator in HTA mode:

  To laucnh System Animator in HTA mode, go to the "Mode" tab of the settings panel, and click "Launch HTA". Once an animation is configured to run in
HTA mode, you can run the animation again by clicking "Launch System Animator.js" in the animation folder.

Keyboard shortcuts:

- A: Toggle the "Animation Appened Mode", which is used to add child animations. Any animation changing operation (pressing D or F, or via settings
  panel) during the animation appened mode will become the addition of child animation inside the current animation.

- C: Close the gadget (or click on the lower-left corner of the gadget).

- D: Pick a file (usually for image, music or video file). This basically equals the file dropping operation on the gadget version.

- E: Bring up the settings panel.

- F: Pick a folder (usually for changing animation). This basically equals the folder dropping operation on the gadget version.

- G: Toggle the "Gallery Append Mode", which allows you to display random pictures from any folder you selected inside some supported "Animated Picture" animations.
  Check out this video for demonstration (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_pR6gaBG9k).

- O: Change the opacity of the current animation (applied in child animation, or when "Use wallpaper as BG" option is ON).

- S: Change the docking state of the animation. This usually changes the animation size.

- 0-9 (num pad): Show/hide the child animation represented by the number (1-9). 0 toggles the visibility of all child animations simultaneously.

- 1-9 (keyboard): Toggle the input focus of the child animation represented by the number (1-9). This is often needed when a child animation doesn't respond to mouse action
(sometimes in 3D animation).


  Note that an animation (or any child animation within) needs to have the input focus for the keyboard shortcuts to work. The simplest way to confirm input
focus is to click on the target animation.


HINT: A small quick menu will be shown on the lower-left corner of most animations when you place the mouse pointer over the animation, which provides a convenient alternative
for some of the commonly used keyboard shortcut functions.

Feature comparison (vs XUL/WebKit mode):

1) HTA mode consumes the least amount of memory and CPU power (this may vary across different systems)

2) "Spectrum Analyser" gadget, required for monitoring sound output, can be embedded directly inside any HTA animation.

3) MP4 (video) and MP3 (audio) are supported by default, which are the most common types of media on the Internet.

4) Both Windows Media Player (WMP) and Silverlight plugins are supported, which may be needed by some animations.

5) IE10 is available on Windows 8 by default.


---------------------------------------------


Known issues:

1) Transparent background is not supported. However, a similar effect can be achieved with the "Use desktop wallpaper as background" option.

2) File/folder dropping is not supported. Some keyboard shortcuts are available to provide corresponding functions.

3) Battery-related monitors are currently not supported. Fixed values are used in the mean time.
