System Animator - Silverlight support

(document version 1.3)

---------------------------------------------

Introduction:


  Since version 4.1.0, System Animator supports the use of Microsoft Silverlight technology, something similar to Adobe Flash, which integrates
multimedia, graphics, animations and interactivity into a single runtime environment. In order to use Silverlight on System Animator, you need to
download the Silverlight plug-in (you will be prompted to download it if an animation requires it). After that, you can enable Silverlight in the
settings panel of System Animator.

- Advantages of using Silverlight

1) Animation rendering is FASTER (i.e. using LESS CPU resource).

2) It supports using VIDEOS (MP4, WMV) as animation parts, instead of just images. The simplest way to try this feature is to simply drag and drop
any supported video file to the gadget!

3) It allows more freedom in animation resizing. You can now resize an animation down to 25% of the original size.

4) It allows more animation effect options. For example, you can now flip an animation in 3D space by clicking on the edges (details below).


  For now, Silverlight is supported in some "Animated Picture" animations (mainly those that uses the "use_HTML_IMG" parameter). When Silverlight is
in action, you will see the "Silverlight" message at the top-left corner when the animation starts. Using Silverlight on System Animator is totally OPTIONAL,
so for other animations that don't use Silverlight, or when you simply disable it in the settings panel, animations will still run as normal.

  The following video should give you some ideas of what you can expect with the Silverlight option.

Controls:


- Resize

  You can resize a Silverlight animation from normal size, 75%, 50%, and down to the smallest 25% size. Click on the top-left corner of the animation
to shrink. Click on the bottom-right corner to enlarge.


- Full-Screen

  You can go to full-screen mode by double-clicking on the top-right corner of an animation.

  NOTE: Some animations may not support full-screen mode.


- 3D Flip

  You can flip a Silverlight animation in 3D space. Click on any of the 4 sides of the animation to flip the animation along the corresponding
plane. Click elsewhere on the animation to reset the 3D orientation back to normal.

  NOTE: Some animations may not support 3D flip.

Windowless/Windowed mode:


  By default, the "Windowless" mode of Silverlight is enabled in the settings panel. In Windowless mode, Silverlight is more seemingly integrated
with the gadget with transparency support and you can move and click the gadget as normal.

  Optionally, you can disable the Windowless mode to enable "Windowed" mode, which is generally FASTER than Windowless mode. However, you will
lose transparency and the gadget's mouse action behavior will change. You can't directly drag a Windowed Silverlight gadget, and the settings
and close buttons won't show up either. You have to click on the "UNLOCK" button at the center of the animation in order to re-enable these actions,
and click on the "LOCK" button to re-enable the animation display. Normally, you don't need the Windowed mode except for any potential performance
gain for those CPU-intensive animations.

64-bit Windows support:

  Windows 7 SP1 (or above): Silverlight 5 now supports 64-bit Windows. Make sure you have the latest version of Silverlight installed.


  Other Windows version: By default, 64-bit Windows always loads the 64-bit version of sidebar, but there is currently NO 64-bit version of Silverlight plugin that it can use.
A workaround here is to load the 32-bit version of sidebar instead. Check out the following article for details.
