Using customized 3D transform and general CSS for System Animator

(document version 1.0.0)


---------------------------------------------


  On the Advanced => HTML5 => Transform => 3D tab of the settings panel, you can define a direct CSS "transform" property for the animation. In the case of 3D transform, often
you will define a perspective and a translation along the z-axis. Below is an example.


perspective(960px) translateZ(-1120px)


  If this is not enough, you can define a CSS rule for the animation containing more than one CSS properties, which allows more flexibilities. Below is an example.


{transform-origin:100% 50%; transform:perspective(960px) translateZ(-1120px) scale3d(1,1.4628,1.4508) rotateY(90deg)}


  If this is still not enough, you can even define a complete CSS file named "animate.css" and put it inside the animation folder. You have to know the DOM structure of
System Animator well enough to make good use of this feature.
