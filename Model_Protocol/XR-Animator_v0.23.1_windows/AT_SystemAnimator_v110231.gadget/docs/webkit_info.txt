System Animator - Chromium mode (formerly known as "WebKit mode")

(document version 1.3.1)


---------------------------------------------


Introduction:

  NOTE: System Animator 8+ runs on Chromium mode by default.

  Since version 5.0, System Animator can be run as a standalone application (Chromium) WITHOUT the sidebar platform. Running System Animator
in Chromium mode has the following advantages.

1) consumes LESS CPU power (especially with GPU acceleration enabled)
2) supports REAL background transparency
3) allows child animations
4) uses HTML5 Canvas (effectively replacing Silverlight) and other advanced Web technologies to allow more visual effects and possibilities
5) supports using video file (MP4/WebM) directly as animation (this type of System Animator animation is called "SEQ Video"), with chroma key support (ie. transparent background)
6) supports true 3D animations (including MMD)

Laucnh System Animator in Chromium mode:

  NOTE: System Animator 8+ runs on Chromium mode by default.

  To laucnh System Animator in Chromium mode, go to the "Mode" tab of the settings panel, and click "Launch Chromium". Once an animation is configured to run in
Chromium mode, you can run the animation again by clicking "Launch System Animator Chromium.js" in the animation folder.


---------------------------------------------


Keyboard Shortcuts:

- A: Toggle the "Animation Appened Mode", which is used to add child animations. Any animation changing operation (drag-and-drop, or via settings
  panel) during the animation appened mode will become the addition of child animation inside the current animation.

- C: Close the gadget (or click on the lower-left corner of the gadget).

- E: Bring up the settings panel.

- G: Toggle the "Gallery Append Mode", which allows you to display random pictures from any folder you selected inside some supported "Animated Picture" animations.
  Check out this video for demonstration (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_pR6gaBG9k).

- I: (Electron only) Toggle the mouse event temporarily on or off when "Click-thru" mode is in use.

- M: Toggle the WMP mask for supported "Animated Picture" animations.

- O: Change the opacity of the current animation.

- S: Change the docking state of the animation. This usually changes the animation size.

- T: Toggle the "3D Navigation Mode".

- 0-9 (num pad): Show/hide the child animation represented by the number (1-9). 0 toggles the visibility of all child animations simultaneously.

- 1-9 (keyboard): Toggle the input focus of the child animation represented by the number (1-9). This is often needed when a child animation doesn't respond to mouse action
(sometimes in 3D animation).


  Note that an animation (or any child animation within) needs to have the input focus for the keyboard shortcuts to work. The simplest way to confirm input
focus is to click on the target animation.

  Since Chromium mode supports file/folder dropping, you can change animation simply by drag-and-drop just like the gadget version, even though those keyboard
shorcuts to provide similar functions in HTA mode (D and F) are also supported in Chromium mode.


HINT: A small quick menu will be shown on the lower-left corner of most animations when you place the mouse pointer over the animation, which provides a convenient alternative
for some of the commonly used keyboard shortcut functions.


---------------------------------------------


Feature comparison (vs HTA/XUL mode):

1) GPU acceleration is enabled by default for supported systems.

2) REAL background transparency is supported while maintaining GPU acceleration.

3) Direct file/folder dropping is supported, which is convenient for changing animation and some other operations.

4) Chromium mode has the best support for media files, including all media formats supported by both HTA (eg. MP4) and XUL mode (eg. WebM).

5) CSS 3D transforms are supported.

6) CPU and RAM monitors are natively supported without relying on WMI (which requires more system resources).


---------------------------------------------


Known issues:

1) Windows Media Player (WMP) and Silverlight plugins are not supported.

2) Chromium mode requires more memory usage in general, especially for certain types of animations.
