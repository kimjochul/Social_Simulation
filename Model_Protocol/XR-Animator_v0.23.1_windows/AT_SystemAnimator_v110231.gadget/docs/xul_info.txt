System Animator - XUL mode

(document version 1.5.3)


---------------------------------------------


Introduction:

  Since version 5.0, System Animator can be run as a standalone application (XUL) WITHOUT the sidebar platform. Running System Animator
in XUL mode has the following advantages.

1) consumes LESS CPU power (especially with GPU acceleration enabled)
2) allows child animations
3) uses HTML5 Canvas (effectively replacing Silverlight) and other advanced Web technologies to allow more visual effects and possibilities
4) supports using video file (MP4/WebM) directly as animation (this type of System Animator animation is called "SEQ Video"), with chroma key support (ie. transparent background)
5) supports true 3D animations (including MMD)

  Check out the following video introducing HTA/XUL mode with more details.

System Requirements:

- Firefox 4 or XULRunner 2.0 installed
  http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop (Firefox 4 or above)
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XULRunner (XULRunner 2.0 or above, recommended for advanced users)

NOTE: For XULRunner, simply download the ZIP file and unzip it somewhere on your computer. No installation is required.

Laucnh System Animator in XUL mode:

  To laucnh System Animator in XUL mode, go to the "Mode" tab of the settings panel, and click "Launch XUL". Once an animation is configured to run in
XUL mode, you can run the animation again by clicking "Launch System Animator XUL.js" in the animation folder.

  By default, the "Launch XUL" button will start System Animator as a "host", which allows you to host multiple animations and start them all at once in a
single click, pretty much like the Windows Gadget platform.

  To start a new animation inside the host, open the settings panel of any animation inside the host, and click "Launch XUL".

  To close the host (and all hosted animations), right click on "System Animator - Host" on the taskbar and choose "Close".

Keyboard Shortcuts:

- A: Toggle the "Animation Appened Mode", which is used to add child animations. Any animation changing operation (drag-and-drop, or via settings
  panel) during the animation appened mode will become the addition of child animation inside the current animation.

- C: Close the gadget (or click on the lower-left corner of the gadget).

- E: Bring up the settings panel.

- G: Toggle the "Gallery Append Mode", which allows you to display random pictures from any folder you selected inside some supported "Animated Picture" animations.
  Check out this video for demonstration (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_pR6gaBG9k).

- M: Toggle the WMP mask for supported "Animated Picture" animations.

- O: Change the opacity of the current animation.

- S: Change the docking state of the animation. This usually changes the animation size.

- T: Toggle the "3D Navigation Mode".

- 0-9 (num pad): Show/hide the child animation represented by the number (1-9). 0 toggles the visibility of all child animations simultaneously.

- 1-9 (keyboard): Toggle the input focus of the child animation represented by the number (1-9). This is often needed when a child animation doesn't respond to mouse action
(sometimes in 3D animation).


  Note that an animation (or any child animation within) needs to have the input focus for the keyboard shortcuts to work. The simplest way to confirm input
focus is to click on the target animation.

  Since XUL mode supports file/folder dropping, you can change animation simply by drag-and-drop just like the gadget version, even though those keyboard
shorcuts to provide similar functions in HTA mode (D and F) are also supported in XUL mode.


HINT: A small quick menu will be shown on the lower-left corner of most animations when you place the mouse pointer over the animation, which provides a convenient alternative
for some of the commonly used keyboard shortcut functions.


---------------------------------------------


Feature comparison (vs HTA/WebKit mode):

1) XUL mode supports a real transparent background for animations which need this feature.

2) GPU acceleration is enabled by default for supported systems.

3) Direct file/folder dropping is supported, which is convenient for changing animation and some other operations.

4) CSS 3D transforms are supported.

5) Battery-related monitors are natively supported (Firefox/XULRunner 11 or above).


---------------------------------------------


Known issues:

1) Windows Media Player (WMP) and Silverlight plugins are not supported.

2) MP3/MP4 support is available only for Firefox/XULRunner 22 or above.

3) There may be some performance issues when using some versions of Firefox to run System Animator and open other websites at the same time. Using standalone XULRunner to run
   System Animator is recommended for advanced users.
