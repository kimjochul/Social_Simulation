Transfer settings from previous version:

 XR Animator saves its settings on "XR Animator.js" file, under the "AT_SystemAnimator_vxxxx.gadget/TEMP/_config_local" folder. To transfer settings from previous version to new version, simply copy this file to the same location on the new version.

----------------------------

Note on Linux version:

  The Linux version of XR Animator is still under beta testing and has only been tested on Ubuntu so far. Feel free to report any bugs or issues.

  By default, Linux may lock the write access to the settings folder mentioned above, making it impossible for XR Animator to save settings. In such case, you need to manually grant this folder the write access in order to let XR Animator save settings automatically.
